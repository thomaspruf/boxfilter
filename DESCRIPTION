Description: Noise filter based on determining the proportion of neighboring points. A false point will be rejected if it has only few neighbors, but accepted if the proportion of neighbors in a rectangular frame is high. The size of the rectangular frame as well as the cut-off value, i.e. of a minimum proportion of neighbor-points, may be supplied or can be calculated automatically. Originally designed for the cleaning of heart rates, but suitable for filtering any slowly-changing physiological variable.For more information see Signer (2010)<doi:10.1111/j.2041-210X.2009.00010.x>.
